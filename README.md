# Final_Project

Final Project Proposal - Who Wants to be a Millionaire?
We will compare the predictive ability of Linear Regression and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) when applied to stock price analysis.
Our plan is to pull in the daily stock price, volume and other statistics of our selected stock and apply each of the models listed above as through Machine Learning frameworks to then produce some expected values of the stocks.
The expected values will then be compared to the observed values to determine which model produces the best estimate of future prices.
Our analysis will include different time periods for prediction to determine whether different models do better depend on the time horizon for predicting the price.
We plan on using Scikitlearn, Python, Pandas and Matplotlib to analyze the data and review the findings. Our visualizations will be created using one of the following technologies: Tableau, Plotly.
Optional analysis (time permitting):
•	Comparison of multiple stocks across market capitalizations to determine predictive ability of the model with different types of stocks
•	Addition of other models for comparison
•	Analysis of sentiment on stock prices
